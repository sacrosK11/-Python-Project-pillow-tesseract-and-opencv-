Course 5 of 5 in the Python 3 Programming Specialization on Coursera provided by University of Michigan

# About this Course

This course will walk you through a hands-on project suitable for a portfolio. You will be introduced to third-party APIs and will be shown how to manipulate images using the Python imaging library (pillow), how to apply optical character recognition to images to recognize text (tesseract and py-tesseract), and how to identify faces in images using the popular opencv library. By the end of the course you will have worked with three different libraries available for Python 3 to create a real-world data-analysis project.

The course is best-suited for learners who have taken the first four courses of the Python 3 Programming Specialization. Learners who already have Python programming skills but want to practice with a hands-on, real-world data-analysis project can also benefit from this course.

This is the fifth and final course in the Python 3 Programming Specialization.
Learning Outcomes:

    How to inspect and understand APIs and third party libraries to be used with Python 3

    How to apply the Python imaging library (pillow) to open, view, and manipulate images, including cropping, resizing, recoloring, and overlaying text

    How to apply the python tesseract (py-tesseract) library with Python 3 in order to detect text in images through optical character recognition (OCR)

    How to apply the open source computer vision library (opencv) to detect faces in images, & how to crop and manipulate these faces into contact sheets
